# Formula-Train
This is a game that I am working on where you race with trains.

To get the very latest version that may have bugs download the repository and go to builds and scroll to the build that is the newest. If not then use the build in 
releases. Make sure everyone is using the same version or there could be errors.

To play first find your internal IP. You can just google how to find it. Next in the IP slot type it and press host. Then tell others the IP and tell them to press join
and they will join the game. The max players is 5 players and then you will get errors. 

To race use the W key to go forward and the S key to go backwards. A and D keys will make you turn left and right respectively. If you want to play it on the website go 
to gamer-guy12.github.io/Formula-Train-Website.

Goal of the game is to find and touch the green cube first

Website isn't up yet.
