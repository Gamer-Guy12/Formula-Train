# Formula-Train
This is a game that I am working on where you race with trains.


To play first find your internal IP. You can just google how to find it. Next in the IP slot type it and press host. Then tell others the IP and tell them to press join
and they will join the game. The max players is 5 players and then you will get errors. 

To race use the W key to go forward and the S key to go backwards. A and D keys will make you turn left and right respectively. To find the game go into the builds 
folder and find the one that has the largest values. If you want to play it on the website go to gamer-guy12.github.io/Formula-Train-Website.

Please do not distribute copies of this game unless Gamer-Guy12 allows you to.
